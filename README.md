# STAIR-CASE-WIRING

AIM
To control the status of the given lamp by using two – way switches.


APPARATUS REQUIRED:
S.No Name of the apparatus Range / Type Quantity
1 Incandescent Lamp 60W 1 No.
2 Lamp Holder Pendent Type 1 No.
3 SPDT Switch 230V,5A 2 Nos
4 Wires 1/18” As per requirement
5 P.V.C Pipe 1/4" As per requirement
6 Wooden Board - 1 No.
7 Round block - 1 No

PROCEDURE

• Place the accessories on the wiring board as per the circuit diagram.
• Place the P.V.C pipe and insert two wires into the P.V.C pipe.
• Take one wire connect one end to the phase side and other end to the middle
point of SPDT switch 1
• Upper point of SPDT switch 1 is connected to the lower point of SPDT
switch2.
• Lower point of SPDT 1 is connected to the upper point SPDT switch2.
• Another wire taken through a P.V.C pipe and middle point of SPDT switch 2
is connected to one end of the lamp holder.
• Another end of lamp holder is connected to neutral line.
• Screw the accessories on the board and switch on the supply.
